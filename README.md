"Algorithms, Part I & Part II" by Princeton University on Coursera (basically the COS226 at Princeton University).

I use this terrific online course and its well designed programming assignments to recap basics in algorithms.

#### update 11/02/2016
Finished programming assignments week4 of Part I.

* 8-Puzzle: Solve 8-puzzle problem using the A\* search algorithm. (Heap/PriorityQueue)

#### update 10/31/2016
Finished programming assignments week1 to week3 of Part I.

* Percolation - Estimate percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation using union-find algorithm; (Union-Find)
* Deque, RandomizedQueue - Implement these two data structures; (Linear datastructure)
* Collinear - Using sort of slope to find lines on 2D plane. (Sort)
